## Project Overview

This interactive story map explores Mexico City's comprehensive high-capacity transit system, featuring both the Metro and Metrobús (Bus Rapid Transit) networks. Through data visualization and narrative storytelling, the project illustrates how these transportation systems anchor daily life at a metropolitan scale, connecting distant neighborhoods and shaping urban flows across one of the world's largest cities. This project is deployed via GitHub Pages. 

### Content Overview

The story map covers multiple dimensions of Mexico City's transit system:

1. **Metro System**
   - **Origins**: Launched in 1969 with color-coded lines and distinctive station pictograms that became part of the city's visual identity
   - **Current State**: A dozen lines and nearly 200 stations providing frequent service across radial and cross-town corridors
   - **Recent Upgrades**: Infrastructure modernization, rolling stock renewal, operations improvements, and enhanced wayfinding
   - **Rider Experience & Safety**: Platform management, lighting and CCTV improvements, and enhanced accessibility features

2. **Metrobús (BRT) System**
   - **Origins**: Launched in 2005 with center-running busways, off-board fare collection, and level boarding
   - **Growth & Electrification**: Multiple corridors connecting major hubs, fleet renewal with articulated vehicles, and zero-emission buses

3. **System Integration & Equity**
   - **Transfers and MI Card**: Unified fare system simplifying interchanges between Metro, Metrobús, and other modes
   - **Equity & Access**: First-/last-mile connections including safer crossings, improved sidewalks, feeder buses, and bike links
   - **Accessibility**: Retrofits including ramps, elevators, and tactile paving for universal access

4. **Sustainability & Urban Impact**
   - **Climate Benefits**: Mode shift reduces carbon emissions, congestion, and frees street space
   - **Public Space**: Enhanced streetscapes with trees, shade, seating, and stormwater management
   - **Operations & Resilience**: Preventive maintenance, power redundancy, drainage systems, and transparent performance reporting

5. **Future Vision**: Reliable core service, zero-emission fleets, equitable coverage, orbital links, and upgraded stations supporting a healthier, more connected, and resilient Mexico City

## Target Audience

- **Urban planning professionals** seeking insights into large-scale transit system design and implementation
- **Mexico City residents** wanting better to understand their transit system's evolution and future
- **International visitors** planning to navigate the city's public transportation

## Data Sources
