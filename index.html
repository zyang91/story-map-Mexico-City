    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p >Spanning one of the world’s largest urban regions, 
      Mexico City’s high-capacity network combines the grade-separated speed of the Metro with the surface reach of Metrobús.
      It connect local residents from their neighborhoods to job centers, schools, and services. 
      Frequent service, intuitive wayfinding, and expanding fare integration (MI card) simplify door-to-door trips and make transfers more legible across modes. 
      Recent investments prioritize core reliability—track and power upgrades, station renewals, fleet modernization, and growing zero-emission buses—while safety, accessibility, and comfort improvements further open the system to all users with confidence. 
      First- and last-mile projects—safer crossings, sidewalks, bike links, and feeder routes extended the network’s catchment and reduce dependence on private cars. 
      By shifting trips from autos to rail and busways, the system cuts congestion, improves air quality, and reclaims street space for people, and create more vibrant public places. 
      <span class="important-intext">This storymap explores how Metro and Metrobús together shape daily mobility and how the next wave of upgrades can deliver faster, fairer, and more resilient travel for all chilangos.</span></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Mexico City’s high-capacity transit anchors daily life at a metropolitan scale. 
          The Metro,one of the busiest systems in the Americas,connected distant neighborhoods through fast, grade-separated service, 
          while Metrobús extends high-reliability corridors along the surface. 
          <span class="important-intext">Together they shape flows of people, place, and possibility.</span></p>

        <h2>Metro: <span class="header-emph"> Origin</span></h2>
        <p>Opened in 1969 with an initial set of centrally focused stations, 
          the Metro was designed to mitigate the congestion and support a rapidly growing capital. 
          Color-coded lines and distinctive station pictograms simplified wayfinding and quickly became part of the city’s visual identity. 
          Rubber-tired trains enabled fast expansion through the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

        <p><span class="important-intext">Metro Line 1</span>, also known as the "Pink Line," was the first line inaugurated in the system, opening on September 4, 1969. 
          It runs from Pantitlán in the east to Observatorio in the west, covering key central areas and serving as one of the busiest lines in the network. </p>

        <h2>Metro:<span class="header-emph">Today & Upgrades</span></h2>
        <p>Today the Metro spans a dozen lines and nearly two hundred stations, providing frequent service from early morning until midnight across key radial and cross-town corridors. </p>
        <p>Recent investment has focused on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Modernizing core infrastructure: <span class="li-explain">overhauling track, power, and stations</span></li>
          <li>Renewing rolling stock </li>
          <li>Improving operations <span class="li-explain">on the busiest lines—to stabilize service and reduce delay</span> </li>
          <li>upgrades to wayfinding, lighting, and passenger information <span class="li-explain">to make complex transfers more legible and reliable</span> </li>

        <h2>Metro: <span class="header-emph">Rider Experience & Safety</span></h2>
        <p>Crowded peaks and long interchanges define many commuter journeys, <span class="important-intext">but station redesigns, platform management, and targeted crowd control</span> can ease pinch points. </p>
        <p>Recently, Mexico City Metro launched many <span class="important-intext">initiatives ranged from improved lighting and CCTV</span> around staffed areas during peak hours to address harassment and enhance perceived and actual safety. </p>
        <p>In addition, Mexico City Metro also improve their system on <span class="important-intext"> escaslator platform edge</span>, which also contribute to a more comfortable rider experience.</p>

        <h2>Metrobús: <span class="header-emph">Origins</span></h2>
        <p>Launched in 2005, Metrobús introduced center-running busways with off-board fare collection and level boarding, delivering <strong>“metro-like”</strong> reliability at street level. 
          The first corridors targeted high-demand arterials where buses previously competed with mixed traffic. 
          Stations were designed for <span class="important-intext">quick dwell times and seamless transfers</span> to the Metro, cycling networks, and walkable district centers.</p>

        <h2>Metrobús: <span class="header-emph">Growth & Electrification</span></h2>
        <p>Over time, Metrobús expanded along multiple corridors to connect major hubs - <span class="important-intext-level2"> historic center, Reforma, and key intermodal station, with airport access via dedicated alignments</span>. 
          Fleet renewal emphasizes higher-capacity articulated vehicles and a growing share of zero-emission buses. 
          Planned extensions and orbital links aim to relieve pressure on radial routes, shorten crosstown trips, and cut tailpipe emissions along the city’s busiest roads.</p>

          Clearer wayfinding at shared stations, shaded and traffic-calmed walking links, and bike parking expand the reach of each corridor.

        <h2>Equity & Access</h2>
        <p>High-capacity transit can widen opportunity by <span class="important-intext">shrinking travel times to jobs and schools</span>, but many peripheral neighborhoods remain beyond comfortable walking distance.

          <span class="important-intext">Safer crossings, improved sidewalks, feeder buses, and bike links</span> is crucial to maximum the capacity and potential for mass transit.
